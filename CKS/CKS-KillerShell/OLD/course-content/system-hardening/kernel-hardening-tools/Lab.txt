Lab 1: AppArmor
Check existing AppArmor profiles
You're asked to verify if the following AppArmor profiles are available on node01 :

docker-default
snap.lxd.lxc
ftpd
/usr/sbin/tcpdump
Create file /root/profiles.txt on node controlplane . It should contain only these profile names that are available on node01 .


Solution

Check existing profiles


ssh node01
    apparmor_status

The /root/profiles.txt on node controlplane should look like


docker-default
snap.lxd.lxc
/usr/sbin/tcpdump



Ex2: Fix Deployment with wrong AppArmor config
There is an existing Deployment named spacecow in Namespace moon .

It should be configured to use AppArmor profile docker-default , but something seems wrong.

Fix it.


Tip

The AppArmor profile will be configured via annotation, but specific for every container and not the whole Pod.


Solution

We need to use the annotation on Pod level, not Deployment level.

And the annotation needs to reference the correct container name httpd .

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: spacecow
  namespace: moon
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: spacecow
  strategy: {}
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: spacecow
      annotations:
        container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/httpd: localhost/docker-default
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: httpd:2.4.52-alpine
        name: httpd

Verify

On node01 we can run crictl ps .

Then crictl inspect CONTAINER-ID | grep apparmor.
